# Main root
<html>;none;Main root;_ContainerTag;0;The HTML <html> element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.

<section>;Global tag;Content sectioning;ContainerTag;0;The HTML <section> element represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document.

# Text content
Use HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening <body> and closing </body> tags. Important for accessibility and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or structure of that content.
<blockquote>;Global tag;Text content;ContainerTag;0;The HTML <blockquote> Element (or HTML Block Quotation Element) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it).

<bdo>;Global tag;Inline text semantics;ContainerTag;0;The HTML Bidirectional Text Override element (<bdo>) overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.
<br>;Global tag;Inline text semantics;_EmptyTag;0;The HTML <br> element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.

<rb>;<ruby>;Inline text semantics;ContainerTag;0;The HTML Ruby Base (<rb>) element is used to delimit the base text component of a  <ruby> annotation, i.e. the text that is being annotated.
<rp>;<ruby>;Inline text semantics;ContainerTag;0;The HTML Ruby Fallback Parenthesis (<rp>) element is used to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support display of ruby annotations using the <ruby> element.
<rt>;<ruby>;Inline text semantics;ContainerTag;0;The HTML Ruby Text (<rt>) element specifies the ruby text component of a ruby annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography. The <rt> element must always be contained within a <ruby> element.

<s>;Global tag;Inline text semantics;ContainerTag;0;The HTML <s> element renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the <s> element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, <s> is not appropriate when indicating document edits, for that, use the <del> and <ins> elements, as appropriate.

<small>;Global tag;Inline text semantics;ContainerTag;0;The HTML <small> element represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font-size smaller, such as from small to x-small.
<span>;Global tag;Inline text semantics;ContainerTag;0;The HTML <span> element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang.
<strong>;Global tag;Inline text semantics;ContainerTag;0;The HTML Strong Importance Element (<strong>) indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.

<wbr>;Global tag;Inline text semantics;ContainerTag;0;The HTML <wbr> element represents a word break opportunity—a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.

# Image and multimedia
HTML supports various multimedia resources such as images, audio, and video.

# Demarcating edits
These elements let you provide indications that specific parts of the text have been altered.
<del>;Global tag;Demarcating edits;ContainerTag;0;The HTML <del> element represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document.
<ins>;Global tag;Demarcating edits;ContainerTag;0;The HTML <ins> element represents a range of text that has been added to a document.

<tr>;<table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>;Table content;_ContainerTag;0;The HTML <tr> element defines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can then be established using a mix of <td> (data cell) and <th> (header cell) elements.

# Forms

<slot>;Global tag;Web Components;ContainerTag;0;The HTML <slot> element—part of the Web Components technology suite—is a placeholder inside a web component that you can fill with your own markup, which lets you create separate DOM trees and present them together.
<template>;Global tag;Web Components;ContainerTag;0;The HTML Content Template (<template>) element is a mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.

# Obsolete and deprecated elements
Warning: These are old HTML elements which are deprecated and should not be used. You should never use them in new projects, and should replace them in old projects as soon as you can. They are listed here for informational purposes only.

<keygen>;Global tag;Obsolete and deprecated elements;_Tag;1;The HTML <keygen> element exists to facilitate generation of key material, and submission of the public key as part of an HTML form. This mechanism is designed for use with Web-based certificate management systems. It is expected that the <keygen> element will be used in an HTML form along with other information needed to construct a certificate request, and that the result of the process will be a signed certificate.
<listing>;Global tag;Obsolete and deprecated elements;ContainerTag;1;The HTML Listing Element (<listing>) renders text between the start and end tags without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML 2 standard recommended that lines shouldn't be broken when not greater than 132 characters.

<spacer>;Global tag;Obsolete and deprecated elements;_Tag;1;<spacer> is an obsolete HTML element which allowed insertion of empty spaces on pages. It was devised by Netscape to accomplish the same effect as a single-pixel layout image, which was something web designers used to use to add white spaces to web pages without actually using an image. However, <spacer> no longer supported by any major browser and the same effects can now be achieved using simple CSS.
<strike>;Global tag;Obsolete and deprecated elements;ContainerTag;1;The HTML <strike> element (or HTML Strikethrough Element) places a strikethrough (horizontal line) over text.
